# (13) **AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION**

## **13.1 Proposing Amendments**

Any member of Pirate Party UK may propose amendments to this constitution by submitting the proposed changes in writing to the National Executive Committee (NEC).

Proposed amendments must be submitted with a clear and concise explanation of the rationale behind the changes.

The NEC shall review the proposed amendments and consider their impact on the Party's principles and operations.

## **13.2 Approval Process**

Amendments to this constitution shall be approved by a vote of the Party's membership unless specified as an exception in subsection (c) below.

The NEC shall organise a vote on proposed amendments within a reasonable time frame, not to exceed 60 days from the date of submission of the proposed amendments.

Party members in Good Standing, as defined in Section 10, shall be eligible to vote on proposed amendments.

Proposed amendments shall be considered approved if they receive a two-thirds (2/3) majority of the votes cast by eligible members.

## **13.3 Exception: NEC-Initiated Amendments**

The NEC may propose and implement amendments to this constitution without the need for a membership vote in the following exceptional circumstances:

1\. **Legal Compliance**: When amendments are necessary to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations.  
2\. **Urgent Operational Requirements**: When urgent amendments are required to address critical operational issues that cannot wait for a membership vote.  
3\. **Unanimous Vote of the NEC with Safeguards**: When amendments by NEC have 100% vote of the NEC in favour to be implemented. In such cases, the following safeguards shall apply:  
   a. The proposed amendments must undergo a comprehensive review and must be meticulously documented.  
   b. An open discussion will be conducted among NEC members to allow for input and thorough deliberation on the proposed amendments.  
   c. If at least 20% of party members in good standing express disagreement during a 15-day waiting period, the proposed amendments will not advance, necessitating further discussion and potential revisions.  
   d. Complete agreement among all NEC members, as demonstrated by a unanimous vote, is required before the amendments can be officially implemented.  
4\. **Formatting or Clarification**: When amendments are needed to improve the formatting, wording, or clarification of the constitution without changing its substance.

In such cases, the NEC shall have the authority to make and implement the proposed amendments.

Emergency amendments shall be clearly communicated to the Party's membership, and a record of the emergency amendment shall be maintained in the official Party records.

# (14) PARTY MEETINGS

## **14.1 General Meetings**

Pirate Party UK will hold general meetings as needed to handle party matters and engage members. Meetings can be in-person or virtual, as decided by the NEC. Members will be notified at least 7 days in advance. Only members in Good Standing may attend and participate. Decisions must be approved by the NEC before taking effect.

The NEC will set and communicate the quorum for general meetings, usually as a percentage of members or NEC officers.

## **14.3 Business Conducted**

General meetings may address a range of party-related matters, including but not limited to:

1\. Discussion of party policies and positions.  
2\. Election of party officers and representatives.  
3\. Discussing and voting on proposed amendments to the party constitution.  
4\. Consideration of urgent party matters.  
5\. Any other business relevant to the party's mission and operation.

The agenda for general meetings shall be prepared by the NEC or as specified in the party's internal rules and guidelines.

**14.4 NEC Meetings**

The National Executive Committee (NEC) holds meetings or makes decisions asynchronously to address party matters. These can be in-person, online, or a mix of both. Meetings are typically conducted on the PPUK Discord server.

The Leader or a designated officer will notify members of the meeting details and agenda in advance. Members can suggest agenda items and must notify if they cannot attend. Non-NEC participants may join if invited by an NEC member and if there are no objections.

A quorum, defined as a majority of voting members, is required to make decisions. Without a quorum, discussions can occur but no decisions can be made. The NEC aims for consensus; if consensus is not possible, decisions can be made via email with all members given a chance to participate.

All decisions and discussions will be documented and distributed within a reasonable timeframe for review. Decisions must be approved by a majority of NEC members, meaning more than half must agree. A quorum is needed for voting.

NEC members can make official decisions through text chat or other communication methods on a designated Discord channel or other platforms. NEC members can provide updates, discuss plans, make decisions, and review progress, ensuring inclusivity. Members must update and vote regularly to ensure ongoing engagement.

This structured approach ensures efficient and inclusive decision-making processes for the NEC, leveraging both synchronous and asynchronous communication methods.
